KinEmote is an easy-to-use, free application that takes gestures captured by the Microsoft Kinect and translates them into key strokes that any Windows application can recognize. 
Users can easily map their own keyboard keys to each of the gestures recognized by the KinEmote software. 
KinEmote works with Microsoft's Kinect or any other OpenNI compliant camera.
