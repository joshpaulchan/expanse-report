# Expanse | Group 13
## CODE

Expanse is comprised of four subsystems - **Virtualization**, **Window Capture**, **Server**, and **Gesture Capture**. These subsystems have been built in parallel and as of *04.01.2016* are not fully integrated. As such, the code for each subsystem must be run by themselves.

---

### Virtualization

The virtualization engine is a web-app accessible from mobile browsers, powered by [three.js](http://threejs.org). It requires a bare-bones server infrastructure to run.

You'll need [Node.JS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run this subsystem. Make sure those are installed on your system (v4.4.2+ LTS or v5.0.0+ are fine), then follow the steps below. You will be working in the terminal.

1. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the `1_code/Virtualization` folder.

2. Install the required packages by running:
```
$ npm install
...
$ bower install
```
	Grant the permissions necessary if you've been asked - the packages will be installed locally under the `node_modules` directory, not to any system-wide folder like `usr/local` or `C:\Program Files\`. 
	
3. Run the server:
```
$ npm start
```
	This will start the server. It should start the server on `0.0.0.0:3000`, where the `0.0.0.0` means it is publicly accessible (from a device other than itself) and where `3000` is the specific port of that application.

4. Identify your external ip address.

	There are many ways to do this, but the simplest is to google *"what is my ip"*, and Google will tell you what your external IP address is.
	
5. Access the web-app.

	On your phone, navigate to `your.ip.addr.ess:3000` to see the virtualization engine running. If you have a Google Cardboard, this is the time you would slot it in. Otherwise, you can move your phone around and pretend it's a viewfiender, and you should be able to see the scene change as you manipulate your phone.

### Server (GUI only)

As of *04.01.2016*, the only functional component of the server is the GUI.

You'll need [Node.JS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run this subsystem. Make sure those are installed on your system (v4.4.2+ LTS or v5.0.0+ are fine), then follow the steps below. You will be working in the terminal.

1. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the `1_code/Server` folder.

2. Install the required packages by running:
```
$ npm install
```
	Grant the permissions necessary if you've been asked - the packages will be installed locally under the `node_modules` directory, not to any system-wide folder like `usr/local` or `C:\Program Files\`. 
	
3. Run the program:
```
$ npm start
```
	This will start the server GUI. You should see a black goggle icon in the System Tray on Windows or in the Menu bar of OSX - it may blend into the background if you're using a dark theme.
	
You can use the program by right-clicking on the icon, which will display a menu. Clicking on any of the corresponding menu items will create the window if it doesn't exist, or focus the window if it does. None of the controls are functional, but the layout is mostly complete.

### Window Capture

The window capture program is an executable file, which will produce a Picture directory and a compound file in the directory the executable is located in. Simply open Win32Project3.exe under the expanse-report/1_code/expanse-window-capture/Debug/ directory.
	
A blank window will appear- this is just a little visual feedback to allow the user to quit the program. In the actual implementation, there will be no user interface, and the program will simply be a component of the entire structure. Windows will be captured every millisecond, and updated accordingly.

### Gesture Tracking
